                Crave Aid was born from a shared frustration with food waste and
                the everyday question: "What can I make with what I already
                have?". Our team of four set out to solve this problem,
                especially for busy students and young professionals. Inspired
                by personal experiences and user interviews, we envisioned a
                tool that makes meal planning smarter, more sustainable, and
                more personalized.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>My aims for this project were to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Use React to build a clean, usable frontend with intuitive
                  pantry and recipe views.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Work with Firebase to enable real-time ingredient storage and
                  user-specific data persistence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Integrate external APIs, specifically TheMealDB, to
                  dynamically fetch and display recipes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Practice full-stack collaboration—merging UI design with
                  backend logic and debugging complex data flows.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="process" class="part">
              <h2>Process & Challenges</h2>
              <p>
                Crave Aid was a full-stack collaboration that required tight
                coordination between frontend and backend systems. One of our
                biggest hurdles was syncing the complex data from TheMealDB API
                with our React-based UI. The API required two types of calls:
                one to fetch all matching meal IDs and another to retrieve full
                recipe data. To handle this, we built a two-step backend
                pipeline to pull the IDs, query full recipes, and then process
                them into a clean format - counting non-empty ingredients and
                matching them to the user’s pantry.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                The biggest challenge came in communicating this data to the
                frontend. We cycled through multiple serialization strategies -
                2D arrays, maps, even dynamic parameter packing—before landing
                on a solution using a custom Recipe class with getter methods.
                This allowed us to serialize cleanly into JSON and parse the
                data using JSON.parse on the frontend.
              </p>

              <br />
              <p>
                On my end, I designed and built the React frontend, setting up
                both the pantry and recipe pages with search, autofill, and
                results rendering. Once Firebase was integrated by my group
                member for persistent user data, I connected that flow to power
                pantry updates in real time. In the final stretch, I helped
                integrate backend responses into the frontend, ensuring our
                design remained accessible and visually clean while handling a
                lot of dynamic content.

                Here is my proposal for a color palette. It is annotated with
                justifications and the roles the colors play:
              </p>
              <img
                src="../assets/images/paint-cit/color-palette.png"
                alt="Paint the CIT color palette"
              />
              <br />
              <p>
                Finally, here is the final sketch with my chosen color palette,
                followed by an explanation of my design choices:
              </p>
              <img
                src="../assets/images/paint-cit/paint-cit-3.png"
                alt="CIT with updated color palette"
              />
              <p>
                For my redesigned CIT color palette, I chose colors that are
                bright and visually pleasing, but not over-stimulating or harsh.
                The wall tints were selected to reflect sunlight and appear
                lighter, making the space easy on the eyes under both natural
                and fluorescent lighting. The slight green-yellow hue I used
                feels warmer and less bland than the original gray. I used blue
                accents for the railings, doors, and carpet to maintain
                consistency with the original CIT aesthetic but made the tones
                bolder to enhance visual interest. <br /><br />Blue symbolizes
                technology, making it a fitting choice for the CS department,
                and using it on doors also helps visually guide people to entry
                points. Green was chosen to represent focus and
                productivity—both important qualities for students in a learning
                environment. All the colors I selected are relatively bright to
                ensure they remain visible and effective in varying lighting
                conditions. The contrast between green and blue is subtle enough
                to avoid monotony, while still helping define the space. The
                boldness of these shades ensures that even in dim lighting, the
                colors won’t cause eye strain. <br /><br />To confirm the
                palette’s harmony, I referenced color schemes from “Coolors”
                that included complementary shades of blue, green, and orange.
                The redesigned color scheme is calming yet
                stimulating—preventing fatigue while still supporting
                productivity, especially during long hours spent working at the
                CIT. The use of bright orange furniture introduces contrast that
                improves accessibility, helping people easily identify seating
                areas. The green walls prevent the space from feeling too
                sterile, a flaw in the previous gray palette, while the light
                blue carpet helps unify the entire space, giving it a friendly
                and inviting tone.

                I really enjoyed working on this project, and I found it much
                more challenging than I expected to design a cohesive color
                palette that was both functional and accessible - without
                feeling bland or boring. Using Adobe illustrate was also a new
                experience for me, but it worked out well. I was proud of my
                final design, and I was thrilled when it was selected by the TAs
                as one of the top 10 in the class. During an in-class vote, my
                design placed 4th overall, which made me really happy and came
                as a total surprise!
