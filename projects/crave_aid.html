              <p>
                Crave Aid was born from a shared frustration with food waste and
                the everyday question: "What can I make with what I already
                have?". Our team of four set out to solve this problem,
                especially for busy students and young professionals. Inspired
                by personal experiences and user interviews, we envisioned a
                tool that makes meal planning smarter, more sustainable, and
                more personalized.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>My aims for this project were to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Use React to build a clean, usable frontend with intuitive
                  pantry and recipe views.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Work with Firebase to enable real-time ingredient storage and
                  user-specific data persistence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Integrate external APIs, specifically TheMealDB, to
                  dynamically fetch and display recipes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Practice full-stack collaboration - merging UI design with
                  backend logic and debugging complex data flows.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Process & Challenges</h2>
              <p>
                Crave Aid was a full-stack collaboration that required tight
                coordination between frontend and backend systems. One of our
                biggest hurdles was syncing the complex data from TheMealDB API
                with our React-based UI. The API required two types of calls:
                one to fetch all matching meal IDs and another to retrieve full
                recipe data. To handle this, we built a two-step backend
                pipeline to pull the IDs, query full recipes, and then process
                them into a clean format - counting non-empty ingredients and
                matching them to the user’s pantry.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                The biggest challenge came in communicating this data to the
                frontend. We cycled through multiple serialization strategies -
                2D arrays, maps, even dynamic parameter packing—before landing
                on a solution using a custom Recipe class with getter methods.
                This allowed us to serialize cleanly into JSON and parse the
                data using JSON.parse on the frontend.
              </p>

              <br />
              <p>
                On my end, I designed and built the React frontend, setting up
                both the pantry and recipe pages with search, autofill, and
                results rendering. Once Firebase was integrated by my group
                member for persistent user data, I connected that flow to power
                pantry updates in real time. In the final stretch, I helped
                integrate backend responses into the frontend, ensuring our
                design remained accessible and visually clean while handling a
                lot of dynamic content.

                The finished version of Crave Aid is a responsive, user-friendly
                web app that helps users reduce food waste by suggesting meals
                based on what they already have at home. The app features a
                searchable pantry system where users can add or remove
                ingredients, and a recipe recommendation engine powered by
                TheMealDB API. Each recipe includes a name, image, and match
                score based on pantry overlap, helping users make smart cooking
                choices fast.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                Built with React, Firebase, and custom backend logic in Java,
                the app also supports persistent user data and dietary
                filtering. I focused on designing and implementing the
                frontend—ensuring that both functionality and layout were clean,
                accessible, and intuitive to use. Users can easily switch
                between views, search for items, and get instant recipe feedback
                with no setup required.

                Crave Aid was one of the most technically ambitious and
                collaborative projects I have worked on. It challenged me to
                think deeply about both user needs and developer communication.
                On the frontend, I learned how to build scalable, clean React
                interfaces while making sure the user experience remained
                seamless and intuitive. I also gained experience integrating
                with Firebase for real-time data handling, and working closely
                with backend teammates to troubleshoot data transfer issues
                across systems.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Working in a full-stack team taught me how crucial clear
                communication is - especially when it comes to passing complex
                data structures between the front-end and back-end. I am very
                proud of how we navigated those challenges and shipped a product
                that not only worked well but solves a meaningful, real-world
                problem that many of us face. This project pushed me to become
                more confident as both a developer and a teammate.
