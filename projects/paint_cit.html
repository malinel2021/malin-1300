                For this project, I redesigned the visual identity of the CIT
                (Brown University's Computer Science building), which is going
                to be repainted in the near future. In this assignment, I
                proposed a new color palette for the building’s interior based
                on principles of accessibility, mood, and color functionality.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The CIT acts as a user interface in itself, and this project
                encouraged us to think about physical space through a design
                lens, considering how colors influence both usability and
                emotion. Through exploring the existing layout, evaluating
                lighting, and experimenting with paint swatches, I developed a
                palette that improves both the atmosphere and clarity of the
                space.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>My aims for this project were to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Learn how color can act as a functional and emotional
                  indicator in physical spaces
                </li>
                <li>
                  Develop a color palette that balances design, usability, and
                  accessibility
                </li>
                <li>
                  Explore how light and material interact with color in a
                  multi-floor building
                </li>

                I chose to focus on the main area of the CIT building, the 1st
                floor atrium, because it is the place most people visit/pass
                through. This area also has both fluorescent lighting and
                natural lighting, which will help me ensure that my new colors
                will work in both types of lighting available throughout the
                building.

              <br />
              <p>
                To help me visualise the redesign and assess the current state
                of the interior and its issues, I sketched this image using
                Adobe Illustrator, color matching the current pallete. Below is
                my sketch of the before picture, followed my my analysis of the
                current state:

                Here is my proposal for a color palette. It is annotated with
                justifications and the roles the colors play:
              </p>
              <img src="../assets/images/paint-cit/color-palette.png" />
              <br />
              <p>
                Finally, here is the final sketch with my chosen color palette,
                followed by an explanation of my design choices:
              </p>
              <img src="../assets/images/paint-cit/paint-cit-3.png" />
              <p>
                For my redesigned CIT color palette, I chose colors that are
                bright and visually pleasing, but not over-stimulating or harsh.
                The wall tints were selected to reflect sunlight and appear
                lighter, making the space easy on the eyes under both natural
                and fluorescent lighting. The slight green-yellow hue I used
                feels warmer and less bland than the original gray. I used blue
                accents for the railings, doors, and carpet to maintain
                consistency with the original CIT aesthetic but made the tones
                bolder to enhance visual interest. <br /><br />Blue symbolizes
                technology, making it a fitting choice for the CS department,
                and using it on doors also helps visually guide people to entry
                points. Green was chosen to represent focus and
                productivity—both important qualities for students in a learning
                environment. All the colors I selected are relatively bright to
                ensure they remain visible and effective in varying lighting
                conditions. The contrast between green and blue is subtle enough
                to avoid monotony, while still helping define the space. The
                boldness of these shades ensures that even in dim lighting, the
                colors won’t cause eye strain. <br /><br />To confirm the
                palette’s harmony, I referenced color schemes from “Coolors”
                that included complementary shades of blue, green, and orange.
                The redesigned color scheme is calming yet
                stimulating—preventing fatigue while still supporting
                productivity, especially during long hours spent working at the
                CIT. The use of bright orange furniture introduces contrast that
                improves accessibility, helping people easily identify seating
                areas. The green walls prevent the space from feeling too
                sterile, a flaw in the previous gray palette, while the light
                blue carpet helps unify the entire space, giving it a friendly
                and inviting tone.

              <h2>Reflection</h2>
              <p>
                I really enjoyed working on this project, and I found it much
                more challenging than I expected to design a cohesive color
                palette that was both functional and accessible - without
                feeling bland or boring. Using Adobe illustrate was also a new
                experience for me, but it worked out well. I was proud of my
                final design, and I was thrilled when it was selected by the TAs
                as one of the top 10 in the class. During an in-class vote, my
                design placed 4th overall, which made me really happy and came
                as a total surprise!
