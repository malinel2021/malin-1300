        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          This project aims to investiage the accessibility of OK/Cancel popup
          dialogs across different websites/interfaces, comparing usability via
          different modes of use to identify best practices and suggest
          potential improvements.

        <h1>Details</h1>
        <p>
          I will be analysing subscription/discount popups on three popular retail websites I have identified:
          <ol>
          <li>Alo Yoga </li>
          <li>Lululemon</li>
          <li>Aritzia</li>

        <div class="container">
            <!-- Alo Yoga Column -->
            <div class="column">
                <h2>Alo Yoga</h2>
                <h3>Process:</h3>
                <p><strong>First State:</strong> Popup appears, asking for an email and a selection (Women/Men/Both).</p>
                <img src="../assets/images/alo-1.png" alt="Alo Yoga - First State" width="100%">
                
                <p><strong>Second State:</strong> Clicking "Continue" brings up a second page asking for a phone number (email is already submitted at this point, even though it is not clear). Asks for a phone number to actually get the discount (somewhat deceptive) </p>
                <img src="../assets/images/alo-2.png" alt="Alo Yoga - Second State" width="100%">
                <p><strong>Final State:</strong> Clicking the "Get 15% off now" button sends a phone confirmation, once confirmed, the popup disappears.</p>
                <img src="../assets/images/alo-3.png" alt="Alo Yoga - Final State" width="100%">
                <hr class="divider">

                <h3>Learnability, memorability, efficiency:</h3>
                <p> <strong>Learnability:</strong> The multiple steps needed, as well as the confusing submission of email, followed by asking the user to put in their phone number in order to actually get the discount makes this not very learnable</p>
                <p> <strong>Memorability:</strong> Users may struggle to remember how this popup works </p>
                <p> <strong>Efficiency:</strong> This popup is not very efficient, as the email and phone number submission boxes are on different pages</p>

            </div>

            <!-- Lululemon Column -->
            <div class="column">
                <h2>Lululemon</h2>
                <h3>Process:</h3>

                <p><strong>First State:</strong> Popup appears, asking for an email.</p>
                <img src="../assets/images/lulu-1.png" alt="Lululemon - First State" width="100%">
                <p><strong>Second State:</strong> Clicking the "Email me 15% off" button immediately sends a discount email to the inputted account.</p>
                <img src="../assets/images/lulu-2.png" alt="Lululemon - Second/final State" width="100%">
                <p><strong>Final State:</strong> A new page appears; clicking "Continue Shopping" closes the popup.</p>
                <hr class="divider">

                <h3>Learnability, memorability, efficiency:</h3>
                <p> <strong>Learnability:</strong> This popup process is very straightforward and easy to understand</p>
                <p> <strong>Memorability:</strong> Users will have an easy time remembering how this popup works </p>
                <p> <strong>Efficiency:</strong> This popup is efficient, as users just submit emails then can close the popup</p>

            </div>

            <!-- Aritzia Column -->
            <div class="column">

                <p><strong>Second State:</strong> Clicking "Subscribe" brings up a second page (email is already submitted at this point). It asks for an optional phone number for additional offers/info and includes checkboxes for preferred contact methods (Call me/Text me - can choose both).</p>
                <img src="../assets/images/ari-2.png" alt="Aritzia - Second State 1" width="100%">

                <hr class="divider">
                <h3>Learnability, memorability, efficiency:</h3>
                <p> <strong>Learnability:</strong> This popup is quite easy to learn, but the second popup page with the optional phone number page and check boxes could be complicated for users to understand</p>
                <p> <strong>Memorability:</strong> Users will likely remember how to use this, but may forget to use the check boxes </p>
                <p> <strong>Efficiency:</strong> This popup is relatviely efficient</p>

This will also make it easier for visually impaired people to recognize a difference in the states, as there is a clear, colorful contrast around the button, allowing them to easily see which component they are currently selecting, helping accessibility.

      <section class="reflection">
        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>- The components I observed did well in terms of usability and efficiency, with some of the popups (like Lululemon) allowing users to only input one thing (email) and click one button to get through the popup. I tried to apply this to my component by putting all the inputs on the same page to reduce steps.<br><br>
        - The components I observed that did well in terms of accessibility made it easy for visually impaired people to navigate. For example, darkening a button when it is being focused on clearly shows users what they are currently selecting. I applied this to my component by changing the submit button to have a thick, bright border around it. This helped solve a mismatch (a mismatched interaction between the features of a person’s body and the features of the environment in which they live), as it allowed people with visual impairments/blind users to use the popup regardless of their abilities.<br><br>
        - Alo Yoga’s selection menu (Women/Men/Both) was unclear for keyboard users because it did not indicate that arrow keys should be used to navigate the choices. I ensured users could also use the Tab key to navigate the choices, as that is often the most common instinct people have.<br><br>
        - Checkboxes being toggleable using the spacebar (which is also read out by the screen reader) helps users understand how to interact with them. This ensures that people who are blind or visually impaired can make the correct choices when interacting with these popups, making their experience more accessible.<br><br>
        - The lack of screen reader support that reads the information on the popups makes it harder for people who rely on screen readers (blind, visually impaired, etc.) to understand the purpose of the popup, making their interactions more difficult.<br><br>
        - I think mouse and touch/mobile users are commonly prioritized during the creation of components, which negatively affects people that use keyboards and screen readers (which could include disabled people, etc.) as their needs are often overlooked, making their lives harder, and their user experiences less positive.<br><br>
